## Setup
To send files it is necessary to run the program on two computers. On the sender's computer it is necessary to send the required files or folder to the program interface and select the computer with the added IP address, after which the sending of files will start.<br><br>
In order not to select an IP address, you can run the program with a parameter:<br>
>"C:\Program Files\ShareFiles\ShareFiles.exe" -d 192.168.0.2

In order for the program not to ask for confirmation when receiving files, it is necessary to add IP address in the program settings.
